# leetcode.io

This folder contains some of the leetcode questions I have solved in Java.

Practicing leetcode allows me to improve my programming skills along with logical thinking. While attempting a problem, practing whiteboarding and breaking down the questions into small, concrete steps, I am also getting better at problem solving. It also allows me to consolidate my knowledge in data structue and algorithms, which is fundamental in computer science.
